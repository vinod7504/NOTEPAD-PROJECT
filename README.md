# NOTEPAD-PROJECT

In this project I had came through the concept of tkinter and the tkinter module in python. Here I had formed clone of notepad by using the tkinter features. In this we can save the file in text file, we can open the file by clicking on the open file option. In this we have menus and sub menus like file,edit and help menu buttons and sub menu buttons. 

CONCLUSION:

implemented the knowledge of Python Programming to develop Model of Notepad to make less
paper work and automate the typing in electronic devices.
